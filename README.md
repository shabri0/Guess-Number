# Guess-Number
# This code implements a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
# The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
# The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
